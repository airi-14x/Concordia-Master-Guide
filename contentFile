### Freshman's Starterpack // 1st Year Undergraduate
##### Finance and Budgeting
  * Loans and Bursaries: [AFE (Aide financière aux études) for Québec Residents](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/)
  > - [Program Code](http://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/government-loans/quebec/concordia-programcodes.html) for those forms
  > - You need to get that **Guarantee Certificate** from the university. That is what you will be using to show the bank in order to get those loans.
  > - You need to be full-time / take 12 credits per semester to stay eligible. The bursaries stop after your 30th month and you will only get loans afterwards. If you happen to go part-time (take <12 credits/semester) and are not back to being full-time after 6 months, you will be expected to pay back the loans.
  > - You get $$$ in September and January. AFE will check that you are full-time at the end of September and January to make sure that you are still full-time.
  > NOTE: If you drop your classes after drop deadline, you will still be *technically* considered full-time since you have to pay for those classes.

##### Books + Supplies
  * CS Freshman classes: COMP 248, COMP 232, COMP 233, COMP 228, (SOEN 287)
  > You don't need to actually buy the books. You can live with the online resources. If you need those books, [Libgen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec) and get the PDFs. Older editions are OK. These books are heavy and a pain to carry around so if you must refer to books, go for these PDFs.

  * Complementaries / General Electives:
  > It really depends on the class. Some classes actual require them so make sure to attend the first class of the semester and see what the prof says.
  > Amongst the electives that I have taken, the ones that needed books or it was *highly recommended*: LING 222, PHIL 210.
  > Ones that I have taken without needing the book: ENCS 282, ENCS 393, PHYS 284, INST 250.

* Dropping a class and is past the DISC deadline?
> Up until the final, you can drop a class. There's something called a late-DISC. If you are really sure that you will fail the class, the final because you were swamped with other classes, don't fret. Apply for a late DISC. You won't fail the class.

### Sophomore's Starterpack // 2nd Year Undergraduate
##### Classes
* COMP 352 - Data Structures and Algorithms: If anything, this is the class that you need to pay attention for. It's the base for your interviews and your higher level classes. It may be 3 credits, but don't let that fool you. You need to work for this class and it will favour you greatly if you put the most effort you can for this class. Your future self will thank you.

### Junior, Senior and Beyond Starterpack // 3rd Year Undergraduate and +

##### Repayment
> If you don't say anything about how you will pay your loans to your bank, you will go with the default option which is a 6 month government-interest rate.
> [Repayment Info](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/repayment/repayment/upon-completing-your-studies/)
