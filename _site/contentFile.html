        <section id="freshman_important">
          <h5>Important Tasks to Complete for 1st Years</h5>
          <ul>
            <li> Get your <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/students/birks/student-id.html">student ID</a>.
              You need your admission letter to get your card. Head over there 1 to 3 weeks before the semester starts.
              1st place in super crowded location during the start of semester.
            </li>
            <li> Get your reduced OPUS fare. You can get this online: MyConcordia > Student Services > Online OPUS card request.
              But, you have to be full-time for that semester and have your student ID photo taken so, get your student ID first.
              This is another place with an awfully long line.
            </li>
            <li> Get your ENCS student account. You need this to log in to the school's computer and to submit your assignments online.
              Head over to the <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/it/services/encs-user-account.html">Student Centre</a>.
            </li>
            <li> If you want to use your calculator for midterm/finals, you need to get an ENCS approved sticker. Check if your calculator is on this
              <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/calculators.html">list</a> and get that approval sticker.
            </li>
            <li>Books? If you are absolutely sure that you need those books, order <a href="https://stores.concordia.ca/clickcollect/">online</a> and
              pick them up in-store. Yeah, don't go to the bookstore during those first two weeks. The lines are dreadful.
            </li>
            <li>Want to get some Developer goodies? <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>.</li>
            <li>Keep this handy <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec11.html">Academic Calendar</a> saved somewhere.
              Note down at least when the payment deadlines, drop/DISC deadlines and holidays are.

            <li>Dropping a class and it's past the DISC deadline?</li>
            <p>Up until the final exam, you can drop a class. There's something called a late-DISC.
               If you are really sure that you will fail the final and the class because you were swamped with other classes, don't fret.
               Apply for a late DISC, give a reason and it will get accepted. You won't fail the class. It would just show up as DISC on your transcript.
               Just don't go taking that final after you get approved.</p>

          <h5>Registration</h5>
          <ul>
            <li> Literally have no clue what courses you have to take?
              Check out your department's respective <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/programs/course-sequences.html">course sequence</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Register for your courses as soon as you can. When registration is open, it's open for <b>Summer, Fall and Winter</b>. Spots do fill up.
            </li>
            <li>Actually have a choice of which prof to take? Checkout <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1422">RatemyProfessors</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Unless you are a morning person or live literally under 30 minutes away from school, don't take 8h45 classes. Heck, even 10h15 classes feel early at times.
              Likewise, some classes can end at 23h30 so check out when your tutorial/labs end and adjust your schedule if you can. Some labs and tutorials are not mandatory so you don't have to go.
              Just make sure to see if it's worthwhile by attending them during the second week of class.
