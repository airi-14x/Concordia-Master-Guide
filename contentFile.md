###### About Me

> Hello. I'm just a student in their final year of Computer Science. I haven't lived in Rez so I'm inexperience to give you my option on that. Aside that I hope that this guide can be of help to you regardless of what year you are in. This guide benefits CS students the most among all majors because it's based on personal experience. But, it can be seen as compilation of answers that student tend to ask on Concordia's Reddit and some tips that may hopefully serve you well regardless of majors.
> Learn as much as you can and enjoy your journey as a Concordia student. Best of Luck.

### Freshman's Starterpack // 1st Year Undergraduate

##### Important Tasks to Complete for 1st Years

-   Get your [student ID](https://www.concordia.ca/students/birks/student-id.html). You need your admission letter to get your card. Head over there 1 to 3 weeks before the semester starts. 1st place in super crowded location during the start of semester.

-   Get your reduced OPUS fare. You can get this online: MyConcordia > Student Services > Online OPUS card request. But, you have to be full-time for that semester and have your student ID photo taken so, get your student ID first. Another place with an awfully long line.

-   ENCS student account? You need this to login to the school's computer and to submit your assignments online. Head over to the [Student Center](https://www.concordia.ca/it/services/encs-user-account.html)

-   If you want to use your calculator for midterm/finals, you need to get a ENCS approved sticker. Check if your calculator is on this [list](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/calculators.html) and get that approval sticker.

-   Books? If you are absolutely sure that you need those books, order [online]([https://stores.concordia.ca/clickcollect/]) and pick them up in store. Yeah, don't go to the bookstore during those first two weeks. The lines are dreadful.

-   Want to get some Developer goodies? [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

-   Keep the [Academic Calendar](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec11.html) handy. Note down at least those payment deadlines, drop/DISC deadlines and holidays.

##### ENCS Exclusives

-   Dropping a class and it's past the DISC deadline?

    > Up until the final exam, you can drop a class. There's something called a late-DISC. If you are really sure that you will fail the class, the final because you were swamped with other classes, don't fret. Apply for a late DISC, give a reason and it will get accepted. You won't fail the class. Just don't go taking that final after you get approved.

-   All possible [ENCS Courses](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec71/71-70.html#compsci)?

##### Registration

-   Literally have no clue what courses you want to take? Check out your department's respective [course sequence](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/programs/course-sequences.html)

-   Register for your courses as soon as you can. When registration is open, it's open for **Summer, Fall and Winter**. Spots do fill up.

-   Actually have a choice of which prof to take? Checkout [RatemyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1422)

-   Unless you are a morning person or live literally under 30 minutes away from school, don't take 8h45 classes. Heck even 10h15 classes feel early at times. Likewise, some classes can end at 23h30 so check out when your tutorial/labs end and adjust your schedule if you can.

-   Cannot enroll into a mandatory class? Send a email to your program advisor. You can find your respective advisor if you scroll down in your "Student Center" page.

    > **Before that: check out if you are missing the requirements.**
    > Co-requisite: You have to be enrolled in the respective courses at the same time.
    > Pre-requisite: You have to take the course before enrolling in this current course.

-   Restrictions: Some courses give priority to certain majors. So if you are trying to enroll in a Software Engineering section and you are in Computer Science, you are most likely not going to get in that class unless there's free spots at the start of the semester. Even then, some class sections won't open up so check back during the beginning of semester.

-   Waitlisted? Just be wait around and be patient. People tend to drop classes around during the first two weeks of school before DROP deadline.

##### Finance and Budgeting

-   Loans and Bursaries: [AFE (Aide financière aux études) for Québec Residents](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/)

    > -   [Program Code](http://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/government-loans/quebec/concordia-programcodes.html) for those forms
    > -   You need to get that **Guarantee Certificate** from the university. That is what you will be using to show the bank in order to get those loans.
    > -   You need to be full-time / take 12 credits per semester to stay eligible. The bursaries stop after your 30th month and you will only get loans afterwards. If you happen to go part-time (take &lt;12 credits/semester) and are not back to being full-time after 6 months, you will be expected to pay back the loans.
    > -   You get $$$ in September and January. AFE will check that you are full-time at the end of September and January to make sure that you are still full-time.
    >     NOTE: If you drop your classes after drop deadline, you will still be _technically_ considered full-time since you have to pay for those classes.

-   In need of money, but want a job at school? Check out [Work-Study](https://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/work-study.html).

-   Already have health and dental insurance? Don't forget to opt-out at the beginning of semester from the [StudentCare](http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/ConcordiaUniversityundergraduatestudentsCSU_Home).

-   Want to trade some of your time for money? You can opt-out from some club levy-fee. But, be aware that there's no online opt-out for these fees. You have to go visit each club you want to opt-out of in order to get some money back. There is an opt-out period during the beginning of semester so keep a heads up for this.

-   Online Payment: You can pay your fees online. But, avoid using Visa/MasterCard for payment unless you want to pay the _convenience fee_ which is 1.75%.

-   Payment Due Date: You have until the end of the month to pay your tuition fees without getting hit by that late fee. So for Fall, the payment becomes due on September 1st but it's actually due on September 31st.

##### Books and Supplies

-   CS Freshman classes: COMP 248, COMP 232, COMP 233, COMP 228, SOEN 287

    > You don't need to actually buy the books. You can live with the online resources. If you need those books, [Libgen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec) and get the PDFs. Older editions are OK. These books are heavy and a pain to carry around so if you must refer to books, go for these PDFs.

-   Complementaries / General Electives:

    > It really depends on the class. Some classes actual require them so make sure to attend the first class of the semester and see what the prof says.
    > Amongst the electives that I have taken, the ones that needed books or it was _highly recommended_: LING 222, PHIL 210.
    > Ones that I have taken without needing the book: ENCS 282, ENCS 393, PHYS 284, INST 250.

-   School Supplies: If you are hunting for school supplies, be on the look out for deals around late-July until late-August. You can get yourself a $0.10 CAD Hilroy notebook at that time.

-   Buying Books. Please if you don't want to hate yourself, don't go to the bookstore for the first two weeks of school. The lineup will take you around ~30 minutes because all the students have the same idea as you: to get their books when the semester starts. You will have to wait to get into the store and to pay. If you are absolutely certain that you need those books, order [online]([https://stores.concordia.ca/clickcollect/]) and pick them up in store.

-   Don't forget to check out for secondhand books. Most profs don't require you to have a specific edition of a book so you can save $$$.

-   Clickers. Some profs use this as attendance trackers, but hey it's potential free points. Pricey to buy as new. Scout for a used one on FB, Concordia's subreddit, Kijiji or Concordia's Bookshop. You need to register them on Moodle or MyConcordia.

##### Classes

-   **Attend the first class at least.** If you are going to skip class afterwards, that's up to you. But, the first day of class is important because you can acquire the following goods: knowledge about whether your prof can teach, whether you need the book, potential friends/teammates, passwords for the prof's site where they post their notes ...
-   Course Outline and Syllabus. You are looking at your class's roadmap. If you want a guide of how to keep up with the class, this is a good indicator of what you will be taught.
-   [Moodle](http://moodle.concordia.ca): This is where professors put up their lecture slides, reading recommendations, assignments... Profs will tell you where they will be updating their notes so if it's not Moodle, it might be their personal site that is locked with a password.

-   Assignments: If you are in Computer Science or Software Engineering, theorical and coding assignments. Most of the coding ones are submitted are either on Moodle or on [EAS](https://fis.encs.concordia.ca/eas/)

-   Midterms: Most of time it's during the 7th week which is around the end of October for Fall semester and before/after Reading Week Winter semester. That's one of the busiest week of the semester so setup a reminder at least a week before midterm so you can actually study and not cram study. You can call it hell week because having assignments due on that week, plus having classes and examinations. You can see what I mean.

-   Finals: By around week 4 or 5 of the semester, you can check your "My Student Centre" for when your finals are. Check if there's any conflicts. Worst case is that you have 2 exams on the same day... But unless you happen to have 3 exams within 24 hours, you cannot really change that.

-   General electives for Computer Science can be found [here](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec71/71-110.html). These are the preapproved ones that you will get credited for as general electives. Other ones, you should ask your advisor about the credits unless you just want to take the class because well it's fun.

##### Online Classes

-   These classes open up at the start of the semester. Bookmark this [page](https://www.econcordia.com/home/index.aspx)

-   These are still classes. You just don't have to be physically there for class. You still have to study for them and it requires more discipline to stay on track.

-   Assure that you set aside some time to actually listen to the online lectures and participate. Treat it like a regular class.

-   You may have to pay fees to access the course's site. This fee tend to include a digital textbook with it so before buying that book, check that out before spending another $100+ on a textbook.

##### Stress, Grades and Time Management

-   So a new adventure awaits. A heads up is that that for most class in Computer Science and Software Engineering are curved. Even if you get a legit 28% on the midterm, don't fret. If the class average is around a 40%, you are more or less alright. You still have a chance of passing the final and the class.

-   Pay special attention to how you are graded for the classes. Sometimes, you can get away with not doing an assignment and it will only dock you 5%. Time is a commodity. Figure out what you want to prioritise or you will be doing a half-arse job on everything.

-   **Percentage grades do not directly translate letter grades**. I mean or else a lot of students would fail and there is only so many students one can fail.

-   So do those assignments to your best ability because you actually learn more applying the material. Keep up with the lectures. Take the midterm. Take the final and you will be alright. There might be times that you have to do some readings but most of the time you can survive without reading the textbook. Well for CS-related classes that is.

-   A small heads up about letter grades for 200s level courses: if your upper level course require this class as a prereq, you need to get a min. **C-**. "D+" means you passed the class but you have to retake this class later one or you will get stuck and not be able to register for some of your required classes.

-   If you really do get stuck with the class material, pay your professor's office hours a visit. They can help you clarify part of the material. Just make sure you know what you don't understand instead of asking a review of the entire class.

-   [GPA](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/academic-services/undergraduate/grade-point-average.html): So you need an annual GPA of 2.00 to be considered in acceptable standing. That's a "C" average which isn't as difficult considering that the classes tends to get curved to at least a "B-" average. Just be around class average and you are more or less good.

-   If your GPA is 1.50 to 1.99, you would be put in conditional standing. But, this assessment happens only if you attempt 12 credits within one year(Summer/Fall/Winter). So you messed up your first semester in Fall, you still have the Winter semester to boost up your GPA. More information about [Academic Standing](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/students/gpa-assessment-academic-standing.html).

-   You are in trouble if your GPA is &lt; 1.50 though.

### Sophomore's Starterpack // 2nd Year Undergraduate

##### Important Notes

-   You can get stuck with registering for your classes in this year if you land on these conditions:
    -   Trying to register to 400s level classes without completing all your 200s level classes.
    -   Having taken a 200 level class, passed it with a "D+ or lower" and it is a prerequisite for your higher level class.
        > You have to retake the class and get at least a "C-" before being able to register for the up level ones.

##### Classes

-   COMP 352 - Data Structures and Algorithms: If anything, this is the class that you need to pay attention for. It's the base for your interviews and your higher level classes. It may be 3 credits, but don't let that fool you. You need to work for this class and it will favour you greatly if you put the most effort you can for this class. Your future self will thank you.

### Junior, Senior and Beyond Starterpack // 3rd Year Undergraduate and +

##### Repayment

> If you don't say anything about how you will pay your loans to your bank, you will go with the default option which is a 6 month government-interest rate. More info about [Repayment Info](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/repayment/repayment/upon-completing-your-studies/).
