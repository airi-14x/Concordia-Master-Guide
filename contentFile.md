###### About Me

> Hello. I'm just a student in their final year in Computer Science. I haven't lived in Rez so I am inexperience to give you my option on that. Aside that I hope that this guide can be of help to you regardless of what year you are in. This is a compilation of answers that student tend to ask on Concordia's Reddit and some feedback on courses that I have taken as well.

### Freshman's Starterpack // 1st Year Undergraduate

##### IMPORTANT TO-DO List for 1st Years

-   Get your [student ID](https://www.concordia.ca/students/birks/student-id.html). You need your admission letter to get your card. Head over there 1 to 3 weeks before the semester starts. 1st place in super crowded location during the start of semester.

-   Get your reduced OPUS fare. You can get this online: MyConcordia > Student Services > Online OPUS card request. But, you have to be full-time for that semester and have your student ID photo taken so, get your student ID first. Another place with an awfully long line.

-   Books? If you are absolutely sure that you need those books, _order online and pick them up in store_[https://stores.concordia.ca/clickcollect/]. Yeah, don't go to the bookstore during those first two weeks. The lines are dreadful.

##### Registration

-   Literally have no clue what courses you want to take? Check out your department's respective [course sequence](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/programs/course-sequences.html)

-   Register for your courses as soon as you can. When registration is open, it's open for **Summer, Fall and Winter**. Spots do fill up.

-   Actually have a choice of which prof to take? Checkout [RatemyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1422)

-   Unless you are a morning person or live literally under 30 minutes away from school, don't take 8h45 classes. Heck even 10h15 classes feel early at times. Likewise, some classes can end at 23h30 so check out when your tutorial/labs end and adjust your schedule if you can.

-   Cannot enroll into a mandatory class? Send a email to your program advisor. You can find your respective advisor if you scroll down in your "Student Center" page.

  > **Before that: check out if you are missing the requirements.**
  > Co-requisite: You have to be enrolled in the respective courses at the same time.
  > Pre-requisite: You have to take the course before enrolling in this current course.

-   Restrictions: Some courses give priority to certain majors. So if you are trying to enroll in a Software Engineering section and you are in Computer Science, you are most likely not going to get in that class unless there's free spots at the start of the semester. Even then, some class sections won't open up so check back during the beginning of semester.

-   Waitlisted? Just be wait around and be patient. People tend to drop classes around during the first two weeks of school before DROP deadline.

##### Finance and Budgeting

-   Loans and Bursaries: [AFE (Aide financière aux études) for Québec Residents](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/)

    > -   [Program Code](http://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/government-loans/quebec/concordia-programcodes.html) for those forms
    > -   You need to get that **Guarantee Certificate** from the university. That is what you will be using to show the bank in order to get those loans.
    > -   You need to be full-time / take 12 credits per semester to stay eligible. The bursaries stop after your 30th month and you will only get loans afterwards. If you happen to go part-time (take &lt;12 credits/semester) and are not back to being full-time after 6 months, you will be expected to pay back the loans.
    > -   You get $$$ in September and January. AFE will check that you are full-time at the end of September and January to make sure that you are still full-time.
    >     NOTE: If you drop your classes after drop deadline, you will still be _technically_ considered full-time since you have to pay for those classes.

-   In need of money, but want a job at school? Check out [Work-Study](https://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/work-study.html).

-   Already have Health and Dental Insurance? Don't forget to opt-out at the beginning of semester from the [StudentCare](http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/ConcordiaUniversityundergraduatestudentsCSU_Home).

-   Want to trade some of your time for money? You can opt-out from some club levy-fee. But, be aware that there's no online opt-out for these fees. You have to go visit each club you want to opt-out of in order to get some money back. There is an opt-out period during the beginning of semester so keep a heads up for this.

-   Online Payment: You can pay your fees online. But, avoid using Visa/MasterCard for payment unless you want to pay the _convenience fee_ which is 1.75%.

-   Payment Due Date: You have until the end of the month to pay your tuition fees without getting hit by that late fee. So for Fall, the payment becomes due on September 1st but it's actually due on September 31st.

##### Books + Supplies

-   CS Freshman classes: COMP 248, COMP 232, COMP 233, COMP 228, (SOEN 287)

    > You don't need to actually buy the books. You can live with the online resources. If you need those books, [Libgen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec) and get the PDFs. Older editions are OK. These books are heavy and a pain to carry around so if you must refer to books, go for these PDFs.

-   Complementaries / General Electives:

    > It really depends on the class. Some classes actual require them so make sure to attend the first class of the semester and see what the prof says.
    > Amongst the electives that I have taken, the ones that needed books or it was _highly recommended_: LING 222, PHIL 210.
    > Ones that I have taken without needing the book: ENCS 282, ENCS 393, PHYS 284, INST 250.

-   School Supplies: If you are hunting for school supplies, be on the look out for deals around late-July until late-August. You can get yourself a $0.10 CAD Hilroy notebook at that time.

-   Buying Books. Please if you don't want to hate yourself, don't go to the bookstore for the first two weeks of school. The lineup will take you around ~30 minutes because all the students have the same idea as you: to get their books when the semester starts. You will have to wait to get into the store and to pay. If you are absolutely sure that you need those books, _order online and pick them up in store_[https://stores.concordia.ca/clickcollect/].

-   Don't forget to check out for secondhand books. Most profs don't require you to have a specific edition of a book so you can save $$$.

##### Education

-   **Attend the first class at least.** If you are going to skip class afterwards, that's up to you. But, the first day of class is important because you can acquire the following goods: knowledge about whether your prof can teach, whether you need the book, potential friends/teammates, passwords for the prof's site where they post their notes ...
-   Course Outline and Syllabus. You are looking at your class's roadmap.
-   Moodle: Some profs use this and some don't.

##### Online Classes

-   These classes open up at the start of the semester.

-   These are still classes. You just don't have to be physically there for class. You still have to study for them and it requires more discipline to stay on track.

-   Assure that you set aside some time to actually listen to the online lectures and participate. Treat it like a regular class.

-   You may have to pay fees to access the course's site. This fee tend to include a digital textbook with it so before buying that book, check that out before spending another $100+ on a textbook.

##### Stress, Grades and Time Management

##### ENCS NOTES

-   Dropping a class and is past the DISC deadline?
    > Up until the final, you can drop a class. There's something called a late-DISC. If you are really sure that you will fail the class, the final because you were swamped with other classes, don't fret. Apply for a late DISC. You won't fail the class.

### Sophomore's Starterpack // 2nd Year Undergraduate

##### Classes

-   COMP 352 - Data Structures and Algorithms: If anything, this is the class that you need to pay attention for. It's the base for your interviews and your higher level classes. It may be 3 credits, but don't let that fool you. You need to work for this class and it will favour you greatly if you put the most effort you can for this class. Your future self will thank you.

### Junior, Senior and Beyond Starterpack // 3rd Year Undergraduate and +

##### Repayment

> If you don't say anything about how you will pay your loans to your bank, you will go with the default option which is a 6 month government-interest rate.
> [Repayment Info](http://www.afe.gouv.qc.ca/en/repayment/repayment/upon-completing-your-studies/)
