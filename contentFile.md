### Sophomore's Starterpack // 2nd Year Undergraduate

##### Important Notes

-   You can get stuck with registering for your classes in this year if you land on these conditions:
    -   Trying to register to 400s level classes without completing all your 200s level classes.
    -   Having taken a 200 level class, passed it with a "D+ or lower" and it is a prerequisite for your higher level class.
        > You have to retake the class and get at least a "C-" before being able to register for the upper-level ones.

##### Classes

-   COMP 352 - Data Structures and Algorithms: If anything, this is the class that you need to pay attention to. It's the base for your interviews and your higher-level classes. It may be 3 credits, but don't let that fool you. You need to work for this class and it will favour you greatly if you put the most effort you can for this class. Your future self will thank you.
